Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are a type of statistical model that is particularly useful for time-series data and scenarios where the system being modeled has underlying, unobservable (hidden) states. HMMs assume that the system can be in one of several states and that the observed data is generated based on the current state of the system, which changes over time according to some probability distribution.

One of the key strengths of HMMs is their ability to model sequential data, such as speech recognition, financial market trends, or biological sequences. HMMs are particularly well-suited for cases where the underlying states are not directly observable, but can be inferred from observable data. For example, in speech recognition, the actual spoken words (hidden states) can be inferred from the audio signals (observations). Similarly, in finance, HMMs can be used to model different market regimes (e.g., bull and bear markets) that are inferred from observable price movements.

The main advantage of HMMs over simpler models like linear regression is their capacity to handle time-dependent data and account for uncertainty in the hidden states. Unlike decision trees or neural networks, which are static in nature, HMMs are dynamic and evolve over time, making them more suitable for time-series prediction.

However, HMMs are not without their limitations. They assume that the system transitions between states based on a fixed probability, which may not always hold true in real-world scenarios. Moreover, HMMs can become computationally expensive as the number of hidden states increases, limiting their scalability for large and complex problems.
